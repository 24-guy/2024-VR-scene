Manifest

Canvas - draw stuff

Annotation page - This describes many items which will be displayed
in the manifest, e.g. the pages of a book.

Annotation - it is the view port in the Canvas

which will have some content to render on it. More than one annotation can co-exist
in the canvas to grab a bit of it, and arrange itself across the width/height.
Layering raster on the canvas is handled by simply listing various annotations one after the other.

They are rendered in the order they are added, starting back-front.
